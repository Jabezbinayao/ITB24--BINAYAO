        <p>Driven Programming is difficult sometimes but I learned so many about this subject and to understand of this software and to practice coding. My journey of this Driven Programming is hard because I don't understand sometimes but thanks to my classmates to help me if I don't understand the question, and the teachers who teach us smoothly I really understand fast. I learned to emphasize not just to writing a code, one of the key takes me has been very importance by settings goals what success looks likes.Me and my classmates where sharing ideas and feedbacks to we will know fast the question that we will not know how to solve the problem of the code. I learned so many in my mindset of continouos learning, I become more open about experimenting the other codes	and to make a new techniques and I grow with that mindset.I learned so many on ma'am phoebe and sir cliff about basic on Github.Lastly I developed myself to understand this subject by keeping my mind through develop process.</p>
